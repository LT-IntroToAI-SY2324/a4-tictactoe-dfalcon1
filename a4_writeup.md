# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    making the function that defines the winner of the game.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    I would add a computer_player by adding a function that asserts a move after you make a move.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it. 
    I would add a BUNCH(there is probalbly an easier way to do this) of if then statements to the program that analyzes te position of every X and O and have the function act accordingly based on each move. I believe this is how chess AI works.
